# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Icons

**Do not use emoji characters in the codebase.** Instead, use Lucide icons from the `lucide-react` library.

For example, replace:
- `ℹ️` → `<Info />`
- `⚠️` → `<AlertTriangle />`
- `✅` → `<CheckCircle />`
- `❌` → `<X />`

Import icons from `lucide-react` and use them as React components.
