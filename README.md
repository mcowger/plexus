# Plexus

**A Universal LLM API Gateway & Transformation Layer.**

![Dashboard Overview](docs/images/splash.png)

### [🚀 API Reference](docs/API.md) | [⚙️ Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) | [📦 Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

Plexus unifies interactions with multiple AI providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more—under a single, standard API. It handles protocol translation, load balancing, and observability, allowing you to switch models and providers without rewriting your client code.

## Core Features

- **Unified API**: Support for both OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible and Gemini endpoints.
  - Tools like Gemini and ClaudeCode work flawlessly.
- **Protocol Transformation**: Transparently convert requests and responses between different provider formats (e.g., send an OpenAI request to Anthropic Claude).
- **Streaming Support**: Full streaming support with real-time transformation of event streams.
- **Model Aliasing**: Define friendly model names that route to specific provider/model combinations.
- **Intelligent Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple backends for the same model alias using sophisticated selection strategies:
  - **Random**: (Default) Simple random distribution across healthy targets.
  - **Lowest Cost**: Automatically routes to the cheapest available target based on your pricing configuration.
  - **Highest Performance**: Routes based on real-time throughput (Tokens Per Second).
  - **Lowest Latency**: Routes based on Time to First Token (TTFT).
  - **Automatic Cooldown**: Temporarily removes providers from rotation if they encounter errors or rate limits.
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of upstream providers, tracking TTFT, TPS, and error rates to power intelligent routing.
- **Reasoning Support**: Unified handling of reasoning/thinking content from modern models, including Gemini `thoughtSignatures`.
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure your gateway with standard Bearer token authentication for all inference endpoints.
- **Cost Tracking & Management**: Comprehensive cost tracking with support for multiple pricing strategies:
  - **Simple**: Fixed per-token rates.
  - **OpenRouter**: Automatic fetching of real-time pricing.
  - **Tiered**: Advanced volume-based pricing tiers.
- **Pass-through Optimization**: Automatically detects when the incoming request format matches the target provider's native format, bypassing expensive transformations to minimize latency and overhead while maintaining full observability. Active passthrough requests are highlighted with a ⚡ icon in the dashboard logs.
- **Adaptive API Matching**: For providers that support multiple protocols (e.g., both OpenAI and Anthropic formats), Plexus dynamically selects the best protocol for each model to minimize transformation overhead and improve reliability.
- **Deep Debugging**: Easy-to-use raw request and response capture, with detailed information of raw and transformed responses, as well as stream reconstruction.

## Performance Metrics & Observability

Plexus continuously monitors the health and performance of every upstream provider and model. It maintains a rolling window of recent metrics, which powers the intelligent routing engine and provides deep visibility into your LLM infrastructure.

- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: Tracks responsiveness, crucial for interactive applications.
- **Tokens Per Second (TPS)**: Measures overall throughput for each model.
- **Real-time Cost Calculation**: Precise cost tracking for every request, visible in the dashboard.
- **Historical Analysis**: View performance trends and usage patterns over time.

## The Plexus Dashboard

Plexus comes with a comprehensive, real-time dashboard for managing your AI gateway.

### Observability & Debugging
Gain deep insights into your LLM traffic. View request logs, analyze detailed traces, and debug raw payloads.

| Request Logs | Deep Tracing |
