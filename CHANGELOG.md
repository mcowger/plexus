# Changelog

## v0.2.2 - 2026-01-03

### Precision Performance: Smarter Metrics & Smoother Releases

### Key Improvements
- **Refined TPS Calculation**: Improved the accuracy of performance metrics by excluding input tokens from the Tokens Per Second (TPS) count, ensuring a more precise measurement of generation throughput.

### Minor Changes & Fixes
- Fix release automation scripts (`5d369d7`)
- Resolve logic in TPS counting metrics (`fabdf55`)
- Update internal testing suite in `test.ts` (`dd784c8`)

## 0.2.1 - 2026-01-03

### Precision Streams & Performance Insights

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Advanced Stream Management**: Implemented manual stream teeing to resolve locking issues and ensure safe chunk cloning for better data handling ([76fe496](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/76fe496)).
- **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Added comprehensive tracking for Time to First Token (TTFB) and Tokens per Second (T/S) to monitor system efficiency ([acbc281](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/acbc281), [4146ccf](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/4146ccf)).
- **Cost-Based Routing**: Introduced a new `CostSelector` and cost-based target selection logic for optimized resource allocation ([2ef1987](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/2ef1987)).
- **Multi-Stage Token Analysis**: Enhanced the token counting engine to support sophisticated multi-stage processing ([429782b](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/429782b)).

### 🛠 Minor Improvements & Fixes

- **Stream Robustness**: Enhanced debug logging and added automated cleanup with abort detection ([fdf2457](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/fdf2457)).
- **Connectivity**: Improved stability through better disconnect handling ([f599009](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/f599009)).
- **CI/CD**: Switched to using `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes generation ([258e9c4](https://github.com/example/repo/commit/258e9c4)).
